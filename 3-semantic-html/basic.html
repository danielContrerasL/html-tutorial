                <h2>Ghost</h2>
                <p>
                    The Ghost type is notable for having few Pokémon, many of whom have low HP, and moves. In battles, the Ghost-type is useful because it's the only type that has two immunities: Normal and Fighting, both of which are common move types. From Generation VI onwards, Ghost-types are also immune to moves and abilities that prevent escaping, like Block and Shadow Tag.

                    Pokémon of this type are usually connected to fear, the dark and the afterlife. They usually live in abandoned houses, cemeteries, funeral places and uninhabited dark places such as caves. Also, Ghost-type Pokémon tend to be extremely naughty, pranking humans just to see their faces and reactions. Curiously, the more scared a human is, the more power the Ghost Pokémon will have to prank with it. At worst, some Ghost-type Pokemon may have relatively murderous behaviors, such as Jellicent preying on ships and their crews or the Litwick evolutionary family draining the life energy from people that are lost.
